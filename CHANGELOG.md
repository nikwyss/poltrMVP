# Changelog

## 2026-01-29

### services/eidproto
- **Fixed Dockerfile**: Changed from `npm ci` to `pnpm install` since the project uses pnpm as package manager
- **Generated `pnpm-lock.yaml`**: Required for reproducible builds

### services/appview
- **Added Bluesky proxy** (`src/bsky_proxy.py`): Forwards `app.bsky.*` XRPC requests to Bluesky's upstream AppView (`api.bsky.app`), allowing the AppView to extend Bluesky while maintaining compatibility
- **Added birthDate to account creation**: Set to `1970-01-01` by default for Bluesky compatibility (required field for age verification)
- **Implemented admin account creation flow**:
  - Added `_pds_admin_create_invite_code()` helper function
  - Updated `pds_api_admin_create_account()` to first generate a single-use invite code via admin auth, then create the account with that code
  - This works with `PDS_INVITE_REQUIRED=true` on the PDS

### k8s/secrets.yaml.dist
- **Updated PDS AppView config**: Changed from custom AppView to Bluesky's official AppView for federation:
  ```yaml
  PDS_BSKY_APP_VIEW_URL: "https://api.bsky.app"
  PDS_BSKY_APP_VIEW_DID: "did:web:api.bsky.app"
  ```

### Architecture Notes
- **PDS config** points to Bluesky's AppView (`api.bsky.app`) so official Bluesky clients work
- **Custom frontend** can call `app.poltr.info` directly for poltr-specific features (`app.ch.poltr.*`)
- **AppView proxy** forwards standard Bluesky requests upstream while handling custom routes locally
